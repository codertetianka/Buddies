# Buddies
Welcome to our Buddies app!

This plant care app allows users to add plants to their profile, including by taking an image of a plant they would like to identify, and providing plant care information. Users have the option to turn on push notifications for when each plant needs watering, and also has a streak feature for how long each plant has been kept alive.


# Setup

To get started, fork and clone this repo. Then run:

```
npm install
```
You will need to sign-up to Firebase, Perenuals API and Plant.id API to get API keys. These all have free tiers options.

A .env file will also need to be created to store the API keys for Firebase, Perenuals API and Plant.id API. Once done, run:

```
npm start
```

This will provide a QR code, that can be used to test on iOS using the camera, or on Android by downloading Expo Go. Alternatively, this can be tested on an iOS or Android simulator, however, please note, the functionality has not been built to test the camera in a simulator.
